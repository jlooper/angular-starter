# Angular Multi-Platform Starter

The Angular Multi-Platform Starter is a cloneable template for building apps for the web, for native mobile with [NativeScript](https://www.nativescript.org/), and for desktop with [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/). The template contains a series of npm scripts for running your apps in these environments, as well as a set of conventions for sharing and forking your code for each ecosystem—web, native mobile, and desktop. It is a basic version of Nathan Walker's [Advanced Angular Seed](https://github.com/NathanWalker/angular-seed-advanced).

Once you have everything set up, start a new project by cloning this repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jlooper/angular-starter.git myprojectname
```

Next, navigate to the new project you just built.

```bash
cd myprojectname
```

And install the project’s dependencies from npm.

```bash
npm install
```
